# FitBud Privacy Policy
Published by NewraFrame

Last updated: 2026-01-09

This Privacy Policy explains how FitBud (“FitBud”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use the FitBud mobile application (the “App”).

---

## 1) Information We Collect

### A) Account information
When you create an account or sign in, we collect:
- Email address and authentication credentials (handled by Firebase Authentication)
- Profile information you provide (such as display name)

We also process your Firebase user ID (“UID”), which is used to store your data under your account.

### B) Fitness and workout information
The App is designed to help you track training. Depending on your use, we collect and store:
- Workouts (exercise selection, sets/reps/weights, timestamps, notes)
- Routines and goals
- Personal records (PRs)
- Training preferences and onboarding answers (such as experience level, frequency, goals, and optionally metrics like age/height/weight if you provide them)

### C) Health data (Health Connect)
If you connect Android Health Connect and grant permissions, the App can read and/or write:
- Exercise sessions
- Calories burned (active/total)
- Heart rate
- Weight

Health data is only accessed if you explicitly grant permission and is used solely to provide fitness-related features.

You can revoke Health Connect permissions at any time in Android settings.

### D) Photos and camera
If you choose to upload or capture images, we collect and store:
- Profile photos
- Workout photos

These are stored in Firebase Storage under your account. For cloud synchronization purposes across multiple devices.

### E) Gym discovery and gym popularity
If you use gym search and “gym popularity” features, we process:
- Your gym search queries (sent to our server endpoints to retrieve results)
- Gym identifiers (such as Google Place IDs)

Gym popularity results and rate-limit counters are stored under your account in our database.

### F) Device and app information
We may collect:
- Device identifier used to associate workout entries with a device
- App version

### G) Diagnostics
We collect crash reports and related logs to help diagnose and fix issues, via Firebase Crashlytics.

---

## 2) How We Use Information

We use the information above to:
- Provide core App functionality (saving workouts, routines, goals, PRs)
- Sync your data across devices (via Firebase)
- Personalize your experience (recommendations, training plans, progress views)
- Enable gym search and gym popularity features
- Send and manage notifications you request or enable (for example, recovery reminders)
- Improve reliability and performance (debugging, crash analysis)
- Provide AI-powered coaching and workout audit features (see Section 4)

---

## 3) How We Share Information

We do not sell your personal information.

We share information in the following limited ways:

### A) Service providers / processors
We use third-party services to operate the App:
- Google Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions, Crashlytics)
- Google Cloud services used by our backend

These providers process information on our behalf to deliver App features.

### B) External APIs used by backend
Some features require our backend to call external APIs. In those cases, we send only the information needed to provide the feature:
- Google Places API (for gym search autocomplete)
- SerpAPI (for gym popularity data; performed server-side)
- Google Gemini API (for AI coaching and workout audits; performed server-side)

### D) Legal and safety
We may disclose information if required by law, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of users and the App.

---

## 4) AI Coach / Workout Audit Processing

If you use AI Coach or workout audit features, we process your workout/training context (such as exercises, sets, PRs, goals, and preferences) to generate:
- Coaching responses
- Workout summaries
- Suggestions and audits

This processing is performed by our backend services and may involve sending relevant context to the Google Gemini API to produce responses.

We do not intend to use your data to train general-purpose AI models; however, the external AI provider processes inputs and outputs according to their own terms and privacy policies.

---

## 5) Data Retention

We retain your account and fitness data for as long as your account is active, or as needed to provide the App.

Some diagnostic data (e.g., crash logs) may be retained for a limited period by our providers.

If you delete your account (or request deletion), we will delete or de-identify data associated with your account, subject to legal requirements and limited technical constraints.

---

## 6) Your Choices and Controls

- Account information: You can update your profile information in the App.
- Health Connect: You can grant or revoke Health Connect permissions in Android settings.
- Photos: You can choose whether to upload photos.
- Notifications: You can enable/disable notifications in the App and system settings.

---

## 7) Security

We use Firebase security rules and authenticated access controls to protect user data. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we use reasonable safeguards appropriate to the App’s architecture.

---

## 8) Children

The App is not intended for children under 13 (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us so we can take appropriate action.

---

## 9) Contact Us

If you have questions or requests regarding privacy, contact:
- Email: support@newraframe.com
- Developer/Company: NewraFrame

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version in the App or in an associated public location, and update the “Last updated” date above.
